King of the Apocalypse is a turn-based strategy game. Unlike most modern strategy games, there is less emphasis on building armies and overpowering the opponent. Instead, the focus is on puzzle style gameplay--interacting with features on the map to slow your opponent down and prevent him from reaching his objective.
